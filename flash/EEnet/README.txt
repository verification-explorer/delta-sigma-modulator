This code utilizes modules from the Cadence course titled "SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (SV-RNM) Advanced Verification."  I cannot include these modules in the GitHub repository due to proprietary constraints. If you wish to simulate and explore this model, please register for the course, download the database, and navigate to /SVRNM_dx/common/EEnet. Copy the files CapGeq.sv, Isrc_ideal.sv, and Isrc.sv to your cloned repositor
